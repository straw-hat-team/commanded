defmodule Commanded.OpenTelemetry.CommandedAttributes do
  @moduledoc """
  OpenTelemetry span attribute names for Commanded.

  This module provides constant attribute names following OpenTelemetry semantic
  conventions for Commanded-specific span attributes.

  ## Naming Conventions

  All attributes `MUST` follow the OpenTelemetry Semantic Conventions naming guidelines:

  - Prefix with `commanded.` to avoid conflicts with standard OTel attributes.
  - Use `snake_case` for attribute names.
  - Use `_count` suffix for counter attributes (e.g., `commanded.event.count`).
  - Use dot notation for namespacing (e.g., `commanded.stream.version`).
  - To extend a SemConv namespace, use `commanded.<namespace>.*` (e.g., `commanded.messaging.*`).

  ## Latency vs Lag

  In messaging systems (Kafka, Pulsar, NATS, RabbitMQ), **"lag"** universally refers
  to **offset-based distance** — how many messages the consumer is behind the head of
  the stream. It is a count, not a duration.

  This library follows that convention:

  - **"latency"** = a time-based duration (e.g., `commanded.handler.processing_latency`
    measures elapsed milliseconds from event creation to handler processing).
  - **"lag"** = reserved for offset-based distance (e.g., a future
    `commanded.subscription.lag` would measure how many events a subscription is
    behind the stream head).

  ## Event Handler Span Attributes

  | Attribute | Type | Description |
  |---|---|---|
  | `commanded.application` | string | The Commanded application module |
  | `commanded.handler.name` | string | The handler module name |
  | `commanded.handler.kind` | string | Type of handler (`event_handler`) |
  | `commanded.stream.id` | string | The event's stream identifier |
  | `commanded.stream.version` | integer | The event's stream version |
  | `commanded.correlation_id` | string | Correlation ID for tracing causality |
  | `commanded.causation_id` | string | Causation ID for tracing causality |
  | `commanded.handler.processing_latency` | integer | Milliseconds from event creation to handler processing (delivery latency) |

  Batch event handler spans additionally include:

  | Attribute | Type | Description |
  |---|---|---|
  | `commanded.event.count` | integer | Number of events in the batch |
  | `commanded.batch.first_event_id` | string | Event ID of the first event in the batch |
  | `commanded.batch.last_event_id` | string | Event ID of the last event in the batch |

  Elapsed milliseconds from event creation to handler processing (delivery latency).

  Measures the age of the event at processing time: `now - event.created_at`. This
  reflects how long the event waited in the store before the handler picked it up,
  which is a signal of subscription health and backpressure.

  For batch handlers, reflects the oldest event in the batch (worst-case latency).

  This is distinct from `messaging.process.duration` (how long the handler took to
  execute) and from offset-based "lag" (how many events behind the stream head). See
  the module-level "Latency vs Lag" section for naming rationale.
